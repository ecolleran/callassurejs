        <h2 style={headingStyle}>The Inspiration</h2>
        <p>CallAssure was inspired by my grandma who lives on Cape Cod in Chatham. 
          Since her town is small and has a high percentage of elderly residents, the Chatham Police Department created a "reassurance program." 
          They wait for participants to call them each morning, then manually call residents or visit their homes if they receive no response. 
          Unfortunately, this model doesn't scale well to any decently sized city with a busy police or EMS force. 
          It is time consuming and costly to have a phone operator working all morning. And so, CallAssure was born!</p>

      <section style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={headingStyle}>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Each day users check-in via App, text message or phone call to certify they are okay. 
          This can be done any time of day. If a user fails to check in by their decided time, they will receive a phone call, text or App notification asking them to check in. 
          After a certain amount of time or number of attempted contacts, a set of loved ones will be notified. 
          If loved ones are not able to get in contact with the user, then emergency dispatchers can be sent to the user's home for a wellness check.</p>
